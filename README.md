## About The Project

I don’t think anyone who knows technology in this world and they don’t know what Youtube is. Youtube is one of the most popular social media and anyone who uses the internet uses it a lot. When we talk about social media related to videos, I think everyone will think and guess that we are talking about Youtube. 


If we want to find audio and visual-based information in the form of video, almost certainly anyone said we should go to Youtube, even if it is a video for the academic learning process, trying to find out tutorial about how to make something or how to solve some problems, as a medium for watching entertainment, and so on. Seeing a large number of video content on Youtube and the high traffic of visitors on Youtube makes me believe that Youtube will continue to grow rapidly in the next few years, especially if Youtube can continue to increase its popularity and features on Youtube. So far, there is one feature that I think is very interesting, and that is Youtube Trending.

Youtube said on its website that Youtube Trending is one of its features that help viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. More than that I think the feature is very interesting, to be honest, I am also curious about how Youtube Trending works. 

I hypothesize that user interactions like views, likes, comments, and maybe dislikes are one of the factors that determine Youtube Trending. But I’m not sure, I’m not sure. So, to answer my curiosity, I will try to analyze data from Youtube Trending in **India** from **23-07-2020 to 10-10-2022**. 

Before we deep dive into the project I would like to pay my sincere gratitude to **Mr Briit** for providing this amazing **real-time web scraped data**. Kudos to you Mr Briit!

So, let’s get started.

## About Dataset
 We have two data files one is **CSV** and the other one is **JSON**
 
 Our JSON file was uploaded within the repository
 
 **IN_category_id.json**
 
 For the  CSV file, we have given a google drive link because of its large size

In this 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 Project, we will use **Python** to analyze the dataset obtained from youtube to enhance our understanding of:

- Working with web data
-  Framing the right business questions
-  Using Python to perform data cleaning
-  Using Python to perform exploratory data analysis(EDA)
-  Using Python to perform data visualization

**Entire analysis file was uploaded within the repository**

Feel free to check it

**You'll have a great time reading it**
